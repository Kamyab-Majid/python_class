Hassan Rouhani (Persian: حسن روحانی‎, Standard Persian pronunciation: [hæˈsæn-e ɾowhɒːˈniː] (About this soundlisten); born Hassan Fereydoun (Persian: حسن فریدون‎); 12 November 1948)[7][8] is an Iranian politician serving as the seventh president of Iran since 3 August 2013. He is also a lawyer,[9] academic, former diplomat and Islamic cleric. He has been a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts since 1999,[10] member of the Expediency Council since 1991,[11] and a member of the Supreme National Security Council since 1989.[6][12] Rouhani was deputy speaker of the fourth and fifth terms of the Parliament of Iran (Majlis) and Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council from 1989 to 2005.[6] In the latter capacity, he was the country's top negotiator with the EU three, UK, France, and Germany, on nuclear technology in Iran, and has also served as a Shia mujtahid (a senior cleric),[13] and economic trade negotiator.[14][15]:138 He has expressed official support for upholding the rights of ethnic and religious minorities.[16] In 2013, he appointed former industries minister Eshaq Jahangiri as his first vice-president.[citation needed]

On 7 May 2013, Rouhani registered for the presidential election that was held on 14 June 2013.[17] He said that, if elected, he would prepare a "civil rights charter", restore the economy and improve rocky relations with Western nations.[18] Rouhani is frequently described as a moderate. He was elected as President of Iran on 15 June, defeating Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and four other candidates.[19][20][21] He took office on 3 August 2013.[22] In 2013, Time magazine named him in its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In domestic policy, he encourages personal freedom and free access to information, has improved women's rights by appointing female foreign ministry spokespeople, and has been described as a centrist and reformist who has improved Iran's diplomatic relations with other countries through exchanging conciliatory letters.[23][24][25] Rouhani won re-election in the 2017 election with 23,636,652 votes (57.1%).[26] He became the third Iranian President, after Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to win a presidential victory as an incumbent with an increased electoral mandate.
